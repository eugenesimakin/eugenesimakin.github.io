Last year, we did a recap with what we thought were the [best Python libraries of 2015](https://tryolabs.com/blog/2015/12/15/top-10-python-libraries-of-2015/), which was widely shared within the Python community (see post in[r/Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/3wyiuv/top_10_python_libraries_of_2015/)). A year has gone by, and again it is time to give due credit for the awesome work that has been done by the **open source community** this year.
